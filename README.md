## Reflection

The following are some skills I used through completing this project:

* Debugging JavaScript modules using breakpoints set in DevTools.
* Manipulating parts of strings in JavaScript using the `substring()` and `charAt()` methods of the String class.
* Writing helper functions to modularize code and prevent repetition.
* Understanding variable scope in JavaScript.
* Manipulating DOM elements in JavaScript after querying them.
* Iterating through NodeLists to apply event listeners to a collection of related elements using a loop (as opposed to individually).
